## The 'OMG You're cheating' and 'OMG You're using console commands' response.  Basically.

Obviously, this is solely referencing singleplayer games.
Whenever I want something in a singleplayer game, some questions are asked:
1. How badly do I want it (Am I willing to break immersion to do it/get it?) & (How much would it bug me to progress forward without said thing?)
2. How much time would it take to get it?
3. Is the act of getting the thing actually fun?

Keeping those questions in mind, let's put forth a simple in-game scenario:
In the game Fallout 4, I would like to increase the amount of currency (bottlecaps) I have.  For the sake of the example, let's limit my options down to 4.

#####Option 1 (legit):
Roleplay a scavenger/trader and go loot some more places (that aren't story relevant) and find people to trade with in order to increase my cap count.
Immersion is kept.  Time taken is ~hours, depending on the amount of caps I want.  This is inherently grinding, and ain't nobody got time to watch that on a stream, nor actually do it in a game.  Not fun.

#####Option 2 (legit/immersion breaking):
Spam water purifiers in some settlements and rotate through them collecting all the excess pure waters and selling them to the nearest trader (usually in the same settlements).
For me, immersion is broken. In a real post apoc world, this is stupid and noone would buy their own excess water back from me.  Time taken is a few minutes, depending on the rotation I'd be doing.  Again, grindy as all hell, and not fun.  Literally just loading and trading screens everywhere.  Nobody got time for that.

#####Option 3 (exploit/immersion breaking):
Go to certain merchants and steal a high priced item from them, then sell it back to them so it appears in their external inventory again, and repeat.
Immersion is broken as all hell.  Time taken is probably longer than the water purifier thing.  Not fun. 

#####Option 4 (cheat/immersion breaking):
Open console, type "player.additem f <amount>".  Immersion breaking.  Time taken is 3 seconds.  Not fun, but due to time saved, action is trivial.  

If I wanted the caps badly enough to not move forward with anything else before first acquiring the caps, is it not obvious which option is best?  
At the core of singleplayer gaming, here are the things I care about:
* The story.
* Self balancing the game.
* Having as much fun per unit of time spent as possible.
* Breaking immersion for the shortest amount of time possible.

Utilizing certain cheats and modifications allows me the ability to maximize points 3 and 4.  What do I mean by self balance?  It means I like to modify the gameplay such that it's never trivially easy while never being difficult just for the sake of being difficult -- again, contributing to the attempts to maximize points 3 and 4.
Another example of how I like to self balance Fallout would be when I start my streams with a nearly completely empty inventory (with just the clothes on my back, basically), since I've managed to reach a high enough level that sometimes combat becomes trivial (especially with the headshot accuracy bugs and melee damage bugs which all lead to the player being able to become insanely accurate and/or powerful.)

For another scenario involving the acquiring of legendary weapons in Fallout 4, see these 2 reddit posts:

I like using Fallout 4 as an example because it is the perfect game to showcase self balancing, which is one of the best qualities I would say about the game.
It comes with console commands for literally every variable, and all can be easily changed and modified without using 3rd party applications like cheatengine.

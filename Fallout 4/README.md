### What Mods am I using?

Better Generators 10x (Gives 10x more power than normal)
Configurable Fusion Core Drain (Power armor uses less AP when jet pack'ing)
Full Dialogue Interface (Must have)
Imperial Assassin Gear (Cage, Drifter, Spike Armor turns black/white)
NoDotDotDot (Always shows full name of gun no matter how long it is)
Power Armor HUD color changer
Eyes of Beauty Fallout 4 Edition (Change eyes so they don't look so janky)
Wasteland Salon (Makes hair look better)

Building mods:
SSex (More stuff to build)
OCDecorator (Make decorations not free-move)
Homemaker (Even more stuff to build)


Not uploading to this directory because you should get the most updated versions on the nexus.

Let me know if there's any mods you want me to check out!

### What are those commands you're using that begin with bat?  

bat commands are just calls to batch files in the game directory that input console commands.
I use them primarily to call my power armor in, like Stark, or to return to one of my bases.

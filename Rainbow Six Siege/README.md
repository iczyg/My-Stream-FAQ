### Opinion of R6 Siege?

It has potential.  In terms of competitive (where competitive is defined by actual competition and not 'ranked' play), there needs to be some rebalancing of weapons, and IMO there would need to be banning of certain explosive devices.  
The characters feel slightly clunky, but mobile enough to not severely hurt gameplay.  There is no jumping in this game, which seems to be a purposeful implementation, though I would argue it was a mistake.
Right now the main issues are hit registration and fixing the areas where context sensitive actions occur (As it is now, planting barricades, bomb defusers, etc. are set via a distance parameter, when it should be an aura around said object -- right now, if you stand too close to something, the Press F to <action> does not appear)

### How are you such a high level already?  And why so much renown?

Rainbow six siege is very broken in a number of ways.  They don't have host migration, and the experience values are very poorly thought out, among other things.  We can exploit this to farm massive amounts of renown (currency) easily. I go more in depth about the simple process of this in this video:

I am accumulating renown because r6 is expected to release 8 new operators at expensive prices in January (25000 renown each).  Also skins.  

### Play more multiplayer?

Currently I am waiting for devs to fix their netcode, which was expected to be released mid-December.  As of right now, most games are over 100 ping, which is terrible.  The hit registration is absolute crap, and many times the game won't show that an enemy is looking in your direction, when in reality, they are.  All due to bad netcode.
If I have a group of 4 or 5, I'll consider it, but in the current state of the multiplayer, it just isn't fun.  Also balance issues.  P90 has more recoil than mp5.  Mp7 has insane recoil.  Guns like the F2 have nearly none.  Makes sense.  Breaching charges either 1 shot kill if you're too close, or do 0 damage if you're 2 steps back.  Makes sense.  
Nitro cells are unbalanced, because they're literally just C4 from every other shooter game ever.  It should be banned in any competitive format.  The list goes on.

##### I will also occasionally go into empty custom games to explore and highlight certain maps and map areas.

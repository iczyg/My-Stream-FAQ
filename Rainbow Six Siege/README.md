### Opinion of R6 Siege?

It has potential.  In terms of competitive (where competitive is defined by actual competition and not 'ranked' play), there needs to be some rebalancing of weapons, and IMO there would need to be banning of certain explosive devices.  
The characters feel slightly clunky, but mobile enough to not severely hurt gameplay.  There is no jumping in this game, which seems to be a purposeful implementation, though I would argue it was a mistake.
Right now the main issues are hit registration and fixing the areas where context sensitive actions occur (As it is now, planting barricades, bomb defusers, etc. are set via a distance parameter, when it should be an aura around said object -- right now, if you stand too close to something, the Press F to <action> does not appear)

##### I will also occasionally go into an offline Situation in godmode to further explore maps because R6 Siege doesn't have training rooms or empty maps to let players just explore.  It's infuriating.

### Opinion of R6 Siege?

It has potential.  In terms of competitive (where competitive is defined by actual competition and not 'ranked' play), there needs to be some rebalancing of weapons, and IMO there would need to be banning of certain explosive devices.  
The characters feel slightly clunky, but mobile enough to not severely hurt gameplay.  There is no jumping in this game, which seems to be a purposeful implementation, though I would argue it was a mistake.
Right now the main issues are hit registration and fixing the areas where context sensitive actions occur (As it is now, planting barricades, bomb defusers, etc. are set via a distance parameter, when it should be an aura around said object -- right now, if you stand too close to something, the Press F to <action> does not appear)

### How are you such a high level already?  And why so much renown?

Rainbow six siege is very broken in a number of ways.  They don't have host migration, and the experience values are very poorly thought out, among other things.  We can exploit this to farm massive amounts of renown (currency) easily. I go more in depth about the simple process of this in this video:

I am accumulating renown because r6 is expected to release 8 new operators at expensive prices in January (25000 renown each).  Also skins.  

##### I will also occasionally go into empty custom games to explore and highlight certain maps and map areas.

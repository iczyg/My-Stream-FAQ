Work in progress.  Most basic thing to note is that silencers are bad because the damage falloff multiplies further when you have to take more shots.
Guns will also never do their stated base damage.  A 552 with 50 stated base damage against the chest of a 1x Armor enemy will do 47, which makes it a 3 shot kill gun, not a 2 shot kill.
Still have to test if Glaz with 2 shot 2x Armor enemies with a silencer or not.

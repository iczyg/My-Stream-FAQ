### What Mods am I using?

None.  In professional league play, mods are not allowed, so I've gotten used to and prefer the vanilla client.  

### Why WoT?  Of all the shooters, why this one?

Well, I'm waiting for the AW community to grow and for eSports to pop up there, but as for "why tanks in general?"  I'd say tank gameplay appeals to me because the mechanics of the game lead to a higher possible skill ceiling of play.  Tanks is a shooter that places less emphasis on the shooting aspect (aiming and shooting is fairly easy, especially with the aimtimes and such), and more of an emphasis on positioning and game sense.  It's more important to know the map, the meta, and how people think more than anything.  That's what I like to see emphasized in a competitive game, with less emphasis on 'can you outclick your opponent?'

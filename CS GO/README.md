### Settings?

config and autoexec are in this directory.  I'm not going to learn proper bunnyhopping, so spacebar will stay my sole jump key.  I have F7 and Numpad 5 bound on my mouse too.

### Opinion on CS, as a whole, and compared to other FPS shooters?

I could probably write an essay on this, and have had many conversations with people from all FPS backgrounds about this.
CS is very much a high skill floor, low skill ceiling game.  It's difficult to get into due to economy, the aiming system and the effects of movement, and the recoil system (during a spray, don't put your crosshair on top of what you want to shoot at, etc)
Once the game is learned though, there isn't that much more between the pros and the above average pubbie, and the CS GO pros have also admitted this.  What separates them from the rest of the pack is having team cohesion for better executes, and having better aim.  
Obviously the differences between the above average player and a pro are noticeable, but they are not extremely significant.

My biggest critique on CS is probably the aiming and recoil system, a point that is valid, though I see ridiculed with 'go back to CoD' comments.  To be 'good' at CS, one must spend hours learning and compensating for ridiculous and unintuitive recoil patterns.  This is part of the 'skill' of CS, something that I would argue is inherently skill-less.  Why?  It is a skill that stands alone, and cannot be applied anywhere else.  It is literally hours wasted on something that is non-applicable to anything else.  I compare this to other aspects of competitive gaming, such as team cohesion, game sense, knowledge of meta, which are all things that are applicable elsewhere, both in other competitive environments and in life.  I believe those to be skills to be honed and focused on, and don't see a point in spending hours to practice an aiming system where its sole use case is CS GO.
People really like the notion of "I can do something you can't, and therefore I am better", and I get that, I really do.  But how much is the skill in question really worth?

### Validity of your opinions?

I come from a competitive CoD4 background, and those knowledgable of competitive FPS would agree that CoD4 was the last respectable CoD game.
I've done both PAM4 and Promod, in various leagues and ladders from TWL to CEVO.  Most players I've seen switch to CS from CoD4 would agree that CS is just the best thing out there right now, and is nowhere near a perfect, or even a great FPS.
I also come from a very competitive WoT background, which is a really high skill floor, somewhat high skill ceiling game.

### How long have you been playing AW?

I've played AW since closed beta, and went through a few iterations of that before open beta/release.

### How would you say AW compares to WoT?

AW has huge potential.  I would say it's WoT but better in terms of gameplay.  The setting is entirely modern, as such, it's entirely different.
AW does arty pretty well, with the high splash, low alpha, and quicker reloads, along with the other shells it can fire.  Huge step up from WoT, and I like to think AW's better arty implementation is what's causing WoT's upcoming arty overhaul.
As it is right now (at the time of typing), AW needs to severely rebalance many tanks though, especially the light tanks, which don't really fill a role too well.
